            <h4>The Web</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The web —a complex system of interconnected components which has become
                    a global repository of vast distributed heterogeneous data and services. The
                    web has metamorphosed through generations from web 1.0 —which allows for
                    published contents to be searched and read (read only), through web 2.0 —
                    which allows for dynamism and collaborations (read and write) to web 3.0 —
                    which extends collaboration by allowing machine participation (read, write, and
                    execute). Web 3.0, also referred to as the semantic web, became incumbent as
                    a result of the need to efficiently and effectively exploit the massive information
                    and services on the web.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Back in 1989, at CERN (the scientific research laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland),
                    Tim Berners-Lee presented a proposal for an information management system that would
                    enable the sharing of knowledge and resources over a computer network. We now know this
                    system as the worldwide web (the web).</p>

                    Information flow on the web is no longer one way, from the web site to the surfer.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In 2006, the concept of Web 3.0 was introduced during the Technet Summit. Jerry Yang, the founder of
                    Yahoo, acknowledged the hardware and software challenges associated with Web 2.0 and proposed the
                    need
                    for a new, truly inclusive web platform. He believed that the power of the web had reached a
                    critical
                    point and called for a web vehicle that would bridge the gap between professional, and
                    semi-professional
                    users, and consumers, encouraging collaborative web interactions and network effects. This new
                    generation of web business and applications became known as Web 3.0.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Since then, influential figures in the internet community, including Google CEO Eric Schmidt and
                    Nifty
                    founder Reed Hastings, have contributed to the discourse surrounding Web 3.0. Tech entrepreneur and
                    investor Chris Dixon has described Web 3.0 as an internet for both builders and users, where digital
                    assets play a crucial role in connecting them.</p>
                <p>However, there is no universally accepted definition of
                    Web 3.0.Web 3.0 represents the tangible manifestation of current technology trends moving towards a
                    new level of maturity. These trends include the internet, network computing, open technologies, open
                    identities, intelligent networks, distributed databases, intelligent applications, and more.</p>

            <h4>History of the World Wide Web</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Way back during Christmas 1990, Sir Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN built all the tools
                    necessary for a working web. They created HTTP, HTML, and the world's first web browser,
                    called WorldWideWeb. The web pages that the first browser could run were simple plain-text
                    pages with hyperlinks. In fact, those first web pages are still online and available to view today.

            <h4>Semantic Web</h4>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Semantic Web technologies are a set of standards and protocols aimed at enhancing the meaning and
                    understanding of data on the World Wide Web. Unlike traditional web technologies that primarily
                    focus on
                    the presentation of information, Semantic Web technologies aim to enable machines to comprehend the
                    semantics or meaning of data, facilitating more intelligent data processing and interaction. At its
                    core, the Semantic Web is based on the principles of annotating data with metadata that describe its
                    meaning and relationships in a machine-readable format. This metadata enables automated reasoning,
                    inference, and integration of disparate data sources, thereby enabling more sophisticated
                    applications
                    and services.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In addition to the classic “Web of documents” and the ontologies, the paradigm of
                    publication, linking, and consumption of data has evolved to support a “Web of
                    data”, whose main goal is generating a global Linked Data ecosystem known as
                    Linked Open Data cloud (LOD cloud), which enables the computers to do more
                    useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the
                    network. In this sense, the Web of data enables developing vertical applications that
                    may bring forward specific and sometimes highly non-trivial use cases, focusing to
                    provide solutions to problems of different industries, such as Health Care and Life
                    Sciences, eGovernment, and Energy, to mention but a few, in order to improve
                    collaboration, research and development, and innovation adoption through Semantic
                    Web technology.</p>
